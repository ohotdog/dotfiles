# dotfiles
Configuration files for my GNU/Linux environment. Frequently updates as I continue to experiment with my workflow and learn best practices.

## How to install
Clone from github and run makesymlinks to backup any existing dotfiles and create symbolic links to the new ones.
```
git clone git@github.com:ohotdog/dotfiles.git
./makesymlinks.sh
```
